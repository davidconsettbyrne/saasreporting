  "executiveSummary": "<p>Actuals are presented through the quarter ended Dec 2025; figures thereafter are forecast. ARR closed at £9.4m with quarterly net ARR of £0.51m in Oct–Dec driven by £0.72m new and £0.24m expansion, offset by £0.41m logo churn and £0.05m downsell. Retention softness in Finance and Professional Services and in Africa/South America held back net retention at ~90% for the year, though the model assumes recovery to ~100% from mid‑2026. Gross margin remains ~78% and operating mix continues to shift from S&M toward efficiency, taking EBIT from -7% in Dec 2025 to positive from Mar 2026 and 6% by Dec 2027. Focus areas: lift gross and logo retention, concentrate go‑to‑market on Energy & Utilities and Life Sciences, and manage Finance & Professional Services exposure.</p>",
  "page1": "<p>Scale and growth: ARR £9.4m; growth 70% YoY. Customers 96; average ARR £98k; ARR per head 147k with 64 heads, indicating capital‑efficient growth.</p><p>Margins and mix: Gross margin 78% and recurring margin 83%; recurring revenue 94% of total. EBIT -7% reflects investment ahead of forecast inflection to profitability (see page 3).</p><p>Retention: Logo retention 85% and gross retention 79% are below benchmarks (91%/91%), driving net retention 90% vs 101% benchmark; consistent with the Oct–Dec churn on page 5.</p><p>Efficiency: CAC ratio 0.56 and LTV:CAC 6.5 are healthy; S&M 37% of revenue is elevated versus benchmark 32% but trending down in plan. Rule of 40 at 63% remains strong given growth.</p>",
  "page2": "<p>Logos and ARR: Ending logos 96 in Dec 2025, up from 68 in Mar 2025. Dec quarter: 8 new, 4 lost; ARR BF £8.91m, retained £8.70m, land £0.72m, net ARR £0.51m to exit at £9.42m. Growth 6% in the quarter.</p><p>Retention and expansion: Dec quarter gross 95%, net 98%. Forecast assumes logo retention ~98–100% and net retention ~98–101%, a step‑up from the current 90% run‑rate on page 1 and the Oct–Dec pattern on page 5.</p><p>Outlook: ARR scales to £17.6m by Dec 2027 with steady new logos (~12–16 per quarter) and improving retention; watch delivery against the assumed churn improvement.</p>",
  "page3": "<p>P&amp;L: Dec 2025 revenue £8.38m with 78% gross margin. Operating costs skewed to S&amp;M 37%, R&amp;D 28%, G&amp;A 20%. EBIT -£0.60m (-7%).</p><p>Path to profit: Forecast expands revenue to £15.8m by Dec 2027 at stable gross margin. Mix shifts reduce S&amp;M to 26% and G&amp;A to 19%, holding R&amp;D ~28%; EBIT turns positive from Mar 2026 and reaches £0.89m (6%) by Dec 2027.</p><p>Unit economics: CAC ratio ~0.56 improving to ~0.53; LTV:CAC 6.5 rising toward 9.7. Headcount grows from 64 to 106, largely in R&amp;D and S&amp;M, with productivity supported by ARR per head of 147k (page 1).</p><p>Risks: Profitability depends on retention normalization and disciplined S&amp;M spend; if churn stays at recent levels (page 5), EBIT timing could slip.</p>",
  "page4": "<p>Where growth comes from: Energy &amp; Utilities (£3.95m ARR) and Life Sciences (£2.50m) are the largest and most resilient contributors; Finance &amp; Professional Services is smaller (£0.90m) and showed recent churn (see page 5).</p><p>Geography: South America (£2.18m) and Asia (£2.09m) lead; Africa (£1.86m) and North America (£1.87m) are close behind; Europe £1.42m. Recent churn is concentrated in Africa and South America (page 5).</p><p>Retention trend: Rolling NRR declined to ~90% through Oct–Nov with a modest uptick in Dec. Expansion remains consistent, but logo losses weighed on gross retention; reinforces the near‑term focus on save‑motions in the at‑risk vertical/regions.</p><p>Customer distribution: Several customers at £90–203k ARR anchor cohorts; land‑and‑expand is working in E&amp;U and Life Sciences. Prioritize CS and upsell where repeated £135–203k expansions are visible.</p>",
  "page5": "<p>Last three months detail (Oct–Dec 2025): Net ARR +£506k = New £720k (8 logos) + Expand £236k – Lost £405k (4 logos) – Downsell £45k.</p><p>By vertical: Energy &amp; Utilities +£461k and Life Sciences +£180k offset Finance &amp; Professional Services -£360k; smaller positives in Government +£135k and 3rd Sector +£90k. Action: tighten qualification and CS coverage in Finance &amp; Professional Services.</p><p>By country: New ARR was broad‑based (NA £360k, SA £180k, Africa £90k, Asia £90k). Churn clustered in Africa and South America; one‑off losses drove most of the -£405k.</p><p>Customer notes: Multiple £90–101k lands/expands in E&amp;U and Life Sciences; three Finance &amp; Professional Services customers accounted for -£315k of churn. Immediate mitigation: executive outreach, value realization plans, pricing/packaging check, and structured win‑back pipeline.</p>"
