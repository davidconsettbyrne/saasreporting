  "executiveSummary": "<p>Results are actuals through December 2025; figures from March 2026 onward are forecast. ARR stands at £9.4m with 70% YoY growth and 78% gross margin. Operating efficiency is sound (Rule of 40 at 63%, CAC ratio 0.56, LTV/CAC 6.5), yet retention softness drags NRR to 90% and EBIT to -7% as of Dec-25. The last three months delivered net ARR of +£0.506m driven by 8 new logos and £0.236m expansions, offset by 4 logo losses (£0.405m) and modest downsell. Strength is concentrated in Energy & Utilities and the Americas; weakness centers on Finance & Professional Services churn. The forecast pivots EBIT positive from Mar-26 with margin expansion as S&M mix eases and retention stabilizes.</p>",
  "page1": "<ul><li>Scale and growth: ARR £9.4m; average ARR per logo £98k; customers 96. Growth trend strong (70%) but retention metrics (logo 85%, gross 79%, NRR 90%) point to churn pressure.</li><li>Quality of revenue: 94% recurring; recurring margin 83%. Non‑recurring margin 4% is intentionally low, reinforcing SaaS mix.</li><li>Profitability: Gross margin 78%. EBIT -7% reflects heavy growth investment; Rule of 40 at 63% signals healthy growth/efficiency balance.</li><li>Go‑to‑market efficiency: CAC ratio 0.56 and LTV/CAC 6.5 are attractive; S&M at 37% of revenue is elevated but trending down in forecasts (see page 3).</li><li>Operating leverage: ARR per head 147k with headcount 64; scope to expand while keeping efficiency if retention improves.</li></ul>",
  "page2": "<ul><li>Q4 actuals (to Dec‑25): Net ARR +£506k on Land £720k and Expand £236k, partly offset by Attrition £405k and Downsells £45k. Quarterly growth 6%.</li><li>Logos: Net logo count rose to 96. Q4 logo retention was 96% vs the trailing 85% on page 1, indicating recent improvement post prior churn.</li><li>Retention mix: Gross retention 95% and Net 98% for Q4; pipeline bias remains toward new lands, so upsell/cross‑sell still underweight.</li><li>Outlook: Forecast maintains steady new logos and rising expands, pushing ARR to £11.1m by Dec‑26 and £17.6m by Dec‑27, contingent on sustaining Q4 retention.</li></ul>",
  "page3": "<ul><li>Revenue and margin: Dec‑25 revenue £8.38m with 78% gross margin. Recurring revenue dominates, aligning with the 94% mix on page 1.</li><li>Spend profile: S&M 37%, R&D 28%, G&A 20%. Plan shows S&M mix easing toward 26% by Dec‑27, supporting margin lift.</li><li>EBIT trajectory: -£0.6m (-7%) in Dec‑25 turning positive from Mar‑26 and reaching £0.9m (6%) by Dec‑27 as opex leverage improves.</li><li>Efficiency: CAC ratio ~0.56 and LTV/CAC 6.5 at Dec‑25; model improves to ~9.7 by Dec‑27 with better retention and ARPA expansion.</li><li>Headcount: 64 at Dec‑25 rising to 106 by Dec‑27, mostly in Product/Engineering and GTM. Maintain hiring cadence in line with retention and pipeline conversion.</li></ul>",
  "page4": "<ul><li>ARR mix: Energy & Utilities £3.95m and Life Science £2.50m lead. Finance & Professional Services £0.90m trails after heavy churn.</li><li>Retention by vertical: Strong in Energy & Utilities and Life Science; Finance & Professional Services shows low gross retention due to a large logo loss (see page 5). Focus customer success and multi‑threading here.</li><li>Geography: Largest books in South America (£2.18m) and Asia (£2.09m). Fastest growth from Europe off a smaller base; Africa and North America show mixed retention tied to specific churn events.</li><li>Trend: Rolling 12‑month NRR drifted down to ~90% through Q4 and flattened in December. Stabilization now is key to unlock forecasted margin expansion.</li></ul>",
  "page5": "<ul><li>Last 3 months actuals (Oct–Dec 2025): Net ARR +£506k. Composition: New £720k (8 logos), Expand £236k, Downsells -£45k, Lost -£405k (4 logos).</li><li>By vertical: Energy & Utilities +£461k and Life Science +£180k offset Finance & Professional Services -£360k from a major churn and smaller losses.</li><li>By country: Strength in North America +£315k and South America +£135k; softness in Africa -£34k tied to churn and a downsell.</li><li>Customer notes: Concentrated losses in Finance & Professional Services; one downsell in Energy & Utilities. New lands diversified across regions, de‑risking concentration.</li><li>Actions: Prioritize save/expand motions in Finance & Professional Services accounts; codify E&U and Life Science playbooks driving recent wins; ensure CS coverage in Africa to prevent repeat downsells.</li></ul>"
