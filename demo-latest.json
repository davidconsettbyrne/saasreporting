  "executiveSummary": "<p>Results are actuals through Dec 2025; Mar 2026 onward reflects forecast. We exit the year at £9.4m ARR, 70% YoY growth, 94% recurring mix and 78% gross margin. Efficiency is strong (CAC 0.56; LTV:CAC 6.5; Rule of 40 at 63%), but retention is the watch-out: gross 79% and net 90% vs benchmarks. EBIT is -7% today, turning positive from Jun 2026 with operating ratios trending down. Last 3 months delivered +£0.51m net ARR on +4 net logos; Energy & Utilities and Life Science offset a drag in Finance & Professional Services. Focus areas: tighten retention, keep S&M productivity high, and pace hiring in line with the margin ramp.</p>",
  "page1": "<p>Scale and growth: ARR £9.4m on 96 customers; average ARR £98k; ARR per head 147 is well above benchmark. Trend lines show steady ARR and customer growth.</p><p>Quality of revenue: 94% of revenue is recurring; recurring margin 83% and gross margin 78% are above benchmark; non‑recurring margin is low (4%) but immaterial to mix.</p><p>Retention: logo 85%, gross 79%, net 90%—all below benchmarks and the clearest constraint on Rule of 40 and EBIT.</p><p>Spend mix and profitability: S&M 37% is elevated vs benchmark; Development 28% and G&A 20% are lean. EBIT -7% near benchmark; trajectory is improving.</p><p>Capital efficiency: CAC ratio 0.56 and LTV:CAC 6.5 indicate efficient growth; Rule of 40 at 63% reflects strong growth offset by negative EBIT.</p>",
  "page2": "<p>Logos and ARR: logos rise from 68 (Mar 25) to 96 (Dec 25) and continue to 168 by Dec 27. ARR steps from £6.84m (Mar 25) to £9.42m (Dec 25), then to £17.65m by Dec 27.</p><p>Growth drivers: consistent land plus material expand (e.g., Dec 25 expand £236k) more than offset downsell/attrition. Forecast keeps expansion healthy and attrition moderating.</p><p>Retention metrics: logo retention mostly mid‑90s to 100%; gross mid‑90s; net ~98–101% in forecast. This supports compounding ARR, but the Dec 25 actuals show lower retention than benchmark—consistent with page 1.</p><p>Deals: deal volume rises through the forecast (e.g., from 1,055 at Dec 25 to 2,098 by Dec 27), consistent with the logo trajectory and S&M productivity.</p>",
  "page3": "<p>Revenue and margin: revenue grows from £8.38m (Dec 25) to £15.82m (Dec 27). Gross margin holds ~78% throughout, indicating stable delivery costs as scale increases.</p><p>Operating leverage: S&M mix declines from 37% (Dec 25) to 26% (Dec 27); G&A trends 24% → 19%; R&D steady at 28%. Operating costs grow slower than revenue.</p><p>Profitability path: EBIT improves from -£595k (Dec 25) to positive from Jun 26, reaching £891k (6%) by Dec 27. Rule of 40 stays 36–49% in the forecast while CAC ratio ~0.53–0.65 and LTV:CAC 6.0–9.7 remain attractive.</p><p>Headcount: scales from 64 (Dec 25) to 106 (Dec 27), with largest adds in Development (29 → 53) and Gross/CS (10 → 26). Hiring plan aligns with product and success capacity while S&M HC is steady (21 → 26), supporting improving S&M %.</p>",
  "page4": "<p>ARR mix: Energy & Utilities £3.95m and Life Science £2.50m lead; Government £1.31m; Finance & Professional Services £0.90m; 3rd Sector & Education £0.77m. By country, South America £2.18m, Asia £2.09m, North America £1.87m, Africa £1.86m, Europe £1.42m—diversified with no single‑region concentration risk.</p><p>Bridge: ARR Bf £5.54m; expand £0.62m; downsell -£0.27m; lost -£0.88m → retained £5.01m; land £4.41m → closing ARR £9.42m; net growth £3.88m (70%). Expansion and land are robust; losses remain the constraint.</p><p>Retention by segment: Energy shows strong gross retention; Life Science shows the best net retention; Finance & Professional Services lags—consistent with page 5 churn. By country, Europe shows stronger retention; North America is softer on gross/net, mirroring recent losses.</p><p>NRR trend: rolling 12‑month NRR softened to ~90% through the year, stabilizing into Dec. Reversing this is the fastest lever to improve Rule of 40 and EBIT.</p>",
  "page5": "<p>Last 3 months actuals (Oct–Dec 2025): net ARR +£506k on +4 net logos (8 new, 4 lost). Components: new £720k, expand £236k, downsell -£45k, lost -£405k.</p><p>By vertical: Energy & Utilities +£461k and Life Science +£180k led; Government +£135k; 3rd Sector +£90k; Finance & Professional Services -£360k (one large loss plus multiple -£90k churns).</p><p>By country: growth concentrated in North America and South America; Africa slightly negative on churn; Asia modestly positive. This aligns with page 4 retention patterns.</p><p>Customer view: expansion and new lands are broad‑based across Energy & Utilities; the largest single negative was a £-405k logo loss in Finance & Professional Services, with additional -£90k events across several customers.</p><p>Actions: prioritize save/expansion plays in Finance & Professional Services and North America; sustain Energy & Utilities and Life Science momentum; route CS capacity accordingly.</p>"
