  "page1": "<h3>Page 1 – Executive metrics overview</h3><p>We closed the period at <b>£9.8m ARR</b> across <b>161 customers</b>, with an <b>ARR per customer of ~£61k</b> and <b>headcount 60</b>. Growth and unit economics remain strong overall, but momentum is slowing and retention quality is mixed.</p><ul><li><b>Growth:</b> ARR growth is <b>42%</b> (vs 19% benchmark), supported by steady new lands and expansion (see Page 2). However, Page 2 shows quarterly growth decelerating to <b>25%</b> in the latest period—flagging a near‑term slowdown.</li><li><b>Margins and mix:</b> Gross margin <b>78%</b> and recurring margin <b>80%</b> are healthy and stable (Page 3 trend confirms 78%). Non‑recurring margin is high at <b>28%</b>, but with <b>96%</b> of revenue recurring, overall mix remains SaaS‑weighted.</li><li><b>Retention:</b> Logo retention sits at <b>91%</b> (in line with benchmark), but <b>gross retention 87%</b> (below 91% benchmark) points to elevated downgrades/attrition. Net retention is <b>101%</b> (at benchmark) but, per Page 2, has softened from earlier highs—an area to tighten.</li><li><b>Efficiency:</b> S&M at <b>27%</b> of revenue, Dev at <b>28%</b>, and G&A at <b>19%</b> are all better than benchmarks (32%, 33%, 22% respectively), underpinning <b>EBIT margin 4%</b> and <b>Rule of 40 at 46%</b>. CAC ratio of <b>0.59</b> and <b>LTV:CAC 10.1</b> signal strong payback, consistent with Page 3 efficiency metrics, though Page 3 shows LTV:CAC trending nearer <b>7.1</b> most recently—still strong but drifting down.</li><li><b>Productivity:</b> <b>ARR per head 163</b> (vs 77 benchmark) remains a key strength, helped by margin discipline (Page 3) and controlled S&M intensity.</li></ul><p><b>Takeaway:</b> The business is executing efficiently with strong unit economics and positive EBIT. The priority is to arrest the recent deceleration and lift gross retention back toward/above benchmark without sacrificing efficiency.</p>",
  "page2": "<h3>Page 2 – Logos, ARR and deal dynamics</h3><p>We grew the logo base from <b>95 → 182</b> over the period, with healthy new logo flow but rising churn pressure and slower net growth.</p><ul><li><b>Logo flow:</b> New logos stepped up from <b>35</b> to the mid‑50s per period, but lost logos also increased (e.g., <b>-17</b> in the latest period). <b>Logo retention</b> improved from the low 80s to ~<b>90–92%</b> earlier, but has eased to <b>88–89%</b> recently.</li><li><b>ARR engine:</b> ARR Bf rose from <b>£4.1m → £8.7m</b>. Expansion remained robust (peaking ~<b>£956–919k</b>), but <b>downsells</b> (e.g., <b>-£531k</b>) and <b>attrition</b> (e.g., <b>-£938k</b>) increased in the latest periods. As a result, <b>ARR retained</b> grew to <b>£8.1m</b> but with more friction.</li><li><b>Growth quality:</b> <b>Gross retention</b> drifted from ~<b>89–91%</b> to <b>83%</b> in the latest period, and <b>net retention</b> moderated from <b>103%</b> to <b>94%</b>. <b>Growth %</b> decelerated from the 30–40% range to <b>25%</b> most recently.</li><li><b>Land and pipeline:</b> New‑logo ARR (“Land”) increased from ~<b>£1.75m</b> to ~<b>£2.75m</b> per period, and <b>Deals</b> volume/value climbed from <b>£2.47m</b> to ~<b>£4.01m</b>, indicating continued top‑of‑funnel health.</li><li><b>Implication for Page 1 metrics:</b> Strong lands and expansion support the current <b>42% ARR growth</b>, but retention softness explains why <b>gross retention (87%)</b> underperforms benchmark and why <b>net retention (101%)</b> has flattened.</li></ul><p><b>Actions:</b> Focus CS and pricing on cohorts with higher downsell/attrition to lift gross retention back toward 90%+, while sustaining land momentum.</p>",
  "page3": "<h3>Page 3 – P&amp;L and headcount</h3><p>The model is scaling with consistent gross margins and improving operating leverage, translating to sustained profitability.</p><ul><li><b>Topline:</b> Total revenue increased from <b>£5.1m → £10.1m</b>; recurring revenue is the driver (<b>£4.9m → £9.8m</b>). Non‑recurring is modest (<b>£243k → £334k</b>), consistent with the <b>96%</b> recurring mix on Page 1.</li><li><b>Gross margin:</b> Value and percentage are steady at ~<b>78%</b> throughout, validating pricing and delivery efficiency.</li><li><b>OpEx mix:</b> <b>S&amp;M</b> declined from <b>31% → ~24–25%</b>; <b>G&amp;A</b> from <b>19% → 16%</b>; <b>R&amp;D</b> held ~<b>28–29%</b>. This mirrors Page 1 where % of revenue for S&amp;M/Dev/G&amp;A beat benchmarks.</li><li><b>Profitability:</b> <b>EBIT</b> improved from <b>-£83k (-2%)</b> to <b>£943k (9%)</b>. Rule of 40 on this page runs ~<b>35–46%</b> across periods; the Page 1 headline <b>46%</b> reflects the latest/TTM view.</li><li><b>Efficiency:</b> <b>CAC ratio ~0.60–0.61</b> and <b>LTV:CAC ~7.1</b> in the latest period corroborate Page 1’s strong efficiency (headline <b>0.59</b> and <b>10.1</b>), noting a recent downtick that warrants monitoring.</li><li><b>Headcount:</b> Total grew from <b>37 → 64</b>, weighted to <b>Development (17 → 33)</b>, with S&amp;M scaling more modestly (<b>11 → 16</b>). Productivity remains high (Page 1 <b>ARR/head 163</b> vs 77 benchmark).</li></ul><p><b>Outlook:</b> We have room to reinvest some EBIT into growth initiatives targeted at retention and selected segments while keeping EBIT positive, given stable gross margin and disciplined OpEx.</p>",
  "page4": "<h3>Page 4 – Cohorts, segments and geography</h3><p>The segment view highlights where churn/downsells are concentrated and where expansion/land is strongest, explaining the retention softness seen on Pages 1–2.</p><ul><li><b>ARR trajectory:</b> On the rolling 12‑month view, ARR rises from ~<b>£3.1m → £4.9m</b>, but <b>gross retention</b> trends down from ~<b>99% → 89%</b> and <b>net retention</b> from ~<b>106% → 88%</b>, consistent with Page 2’s recent 83% gross and 94% net.</li><li><b>Verticals:</b> Largest verticals are <b>Energy &amp; Utilities (£1.99m)</b>, <b>Government (£1.19m)</b>, <b>3rd Sector &amp; Education (£0.94m)</b>, and <b>Finance &amp; Professional Services (£0.75m)</b>. Net growth is strongest in <b>Energy (~49%)</b> and solid in <b>Finance (~40%)</b>; <b>Life Sciences (~£0.41m)</b> shows <b>slight contraction</b>. Prioritize CS and pricing defenses in Life Sciences; double‑down on proven plays in Energy and Finance.</li><li><b>Geography:</b> ARR by region is led by <b>Asia (£1.99m; net growth ~42%)</b> and balanced across <b>Africa (£1.11m; 24%)</b>, <b>Europe (£1.08m; 72%)</b>, and <b>North America (£1.03m; -46%)</b>. <b>North America</b> is the standout headwind with lower gross retention (~<b>61%</b>) despite sizable land activity—this is the main driver of weaker gross retention overall.</li><li><b>Cohort heatmap:</b> Expansions (green 113s) are broad‑based across many customers, but we see pockets of <b>downsells (reds/25s)</b> and cancellations clustered in later months. This concentration aligns with the segment/geographic patterns above.</li></ul><p><b>Actions:</b> 1) Run targeted save/expansion plays in <b>North America</b> and <b>Life Sciences</b> (executive coverage, packaging, term/price alignment). 2) Replicate successful motions in <b>Energy &amp; Utilities</b> and <b>Europe</b> to sustain land/expansion. 3) Tighten renewal hygiene to lift gross retention back toward 90%+ within two quarters.</p>"
