  "executiveSummary": "<ul><li>Context: Results are actuals through the last completed month (December 2025). Figures beyond that point are forecast.</li><li>Topline: ARR £9.4m; 12‑month ARR growth 70% (well above 19% benchmark). Gross margin stable at 78%.</li><li>Efficiency: Rule of 40 at 63%. CAC ratio 0.56 and LTV:CAC 6.5 indicate efficient acquisition; ARR per head 147 vs 77 benchmark.</li><li>Retention: Net retention 90% and gross retention 79% remain the primary drag; logo retention 85% vs 91% benchmark. NRR has trended down to ~90% in recent months.</li><li>Mix: Energy & Utilities (3.95m) and Life Science (2.50m) lead vertical ARR; South America (2.18m) and Asia (2.09m) are the largest regions.</li><li>Last 3 months: Net +£506k ARR (New +£720k, Expand +£236k, Lost -£405k, Downsell -£45k). Strength in Energy & Utilities; weakness in Finance & Professional Services and parts of Africa/North America.</li><li>P&L: FY25 revenue £8.38m; EBITDA -£595k (-7%) with improving trajectory; forecast turns positive from mid‑2026 as scale and spend mix improve.</li><li>Budget: ARR +11% vs plan; EBITDA slightly ahead of plan. Overheads ran hot (S&M +12%, G&A +38% vs budget), offset by revenue outperformance.</li><li>Actions: 1) Retention program to lift NRR back >100% within 2 quarters. 2) Tighten S&M and G&A while preserving CAC efficiency. 3) Double down on winning verticals/regions (E&U, Life Science; South America, Asia). 4) Address Finance & Professional Services churn drivers; reinforce African account coverage.</li></ul>",
  "page1": "<ul><li>Scale: ARR £9.4m across 96 customers; average ARR per customer £98k; headcount 64.</li><li>Growth and quality: ARR growth 70% (vs 19% benchmark). Recurring margin 83% and gross margin 78% (both above benchmarks); non‑recurring only 4% of revenue, improving quality of revenue mix.</li><li>Efficiency: CAC ratio 0.56 and LTV:CAC 6.5 support efficient growth; Rule of 40 at 63% shows healthy balance given scale.</li><li>Spend mix: S&M 37% of revenue is elevated vs 32% benchmark; Development 28% below 33% benchmark; G&A 20% slightly lean vs benchmark.</li><li>Retention pressure: Logo retention 85%, gross retention 79%, net retention 90% — consistent with Page ARR and Transactions showing recent churn/downsell episodes.</li><li>Profitability: EBIT -7% (near benchmark -6%); improving trajectory supported by margins and CAC efficiency (see P&L and Budget Analysis).</li></ul>",
  "page2": "<ul><li>Logos and land: Logos grew to 96 by Dec‑25; Dec‑25 quarter added 8 new logos and lost 4.</li><li>ARR movement (Dec‑25 quarter actual): Start £8.91m; Expand +£236k; Downsell -£45k; Attrition -£405k; Land +£720k; Net +£506k; End £9.42m.</li><li>Rates (Dec‑25 quarter): Logo retention 96%; Gross retention 95%; Net retention 98% within the quarter. Full‑year rolling NRR still ~90% (see ARR page) due to earlier churn.</li><li>Forward view: Forecast builds logos to 168 and ARR to £17.65m by Dec‑27, with moderate quarterly growth (6–10%) contingent on sustained lands and improved retention.</li><li>Action: Maintain new‑logo velocity while prioritizing saves/expansion in at‑risk cohorts to lift rolling NRR back to ≥100%.</li></ul>",
  "page3": "<ul><li>FY25 actual run‑rate: Revenue £8.38m; gross margin £6.58m (78%). Operating costs £7.17m (S&M £3.10m 37%, Dev £2.36m 28%, G&A £1.71m 20%).

Forecast growth to 106 by Dec‑27 with emphasis on Dev and GTM capacity.</li><li>Actions: 1) Rebalance S&M productivity to reduce S&M % toward low‑30s in 2026. 2) Hold G&A growth below revenue growth. 3) Fund CS/renewals to curb churn without materially lifting CAC.</li></ul>",
