  "executiveSummary": "<p>Results reflect actuals through the last completed whole month (December 2025); all periods beyond this are forecast.</p><ul><li><b>Momentum:</b> ARR is £9.4m, up 70% YoY, ahead of budget (+11% ARR vs plan). Rule of 40 at 63% and strong CAC efficiency (0.56) indicate healthy growth efficiency.</li><li><b>Profit path:</b> Gross margin steady at 78%. EBIT is -7% now but improves to positive from mid-2026 on the current plan as operating leverage builds.</li><li><b>Retention is the constraint:</b> NRR has trended down to ~90% on a rolling 12 months, with gross retention at 79% vs a 91% benchmark. The last 3 months delivered net +£506k ARR but included £405k churn (4 logos), concentrated in Finance & Professional Services and Africa.</li><li><b>Where wins are coming from:</b> Energy & Utilities and North America led new/expand in the quarter; additions and land are the main drivers ahead of plan, while upsell underperformed vs budget.</li><li><b>Capital allocation:</b> S&M spend is elevated at 37% of revenue (vs 32% benchmark); Development is 28% (below 33% benchmark). Given retention headwinds, prioritizing customer success and product depth in at-risk segments should raise NRR toward/above 100%.</li></ul><p><b>Immediate actions</b></p><ul><li>Launch targeted save/expansion plays in Finance & Professional Services and Africa; assign exec sponsors to top-10 at-risk accounts.</li><li>Stand up a Q1/Q2 upsell program to close the budget gap in expansions; use Energy & Utilities playbooks where win rates are strongest.</li><li>Rebalance spend modestly from S&M to CS/Product for 2 quarters to lift NRR; hold CAC at or below 0.60.</li><li>Codify a churn early-warning system from the last-3-months patterns; set a board KPI of NRR ≥ 100% by Q4 2026.</li></ul>",
  "page1": "<p>Dashboard</p><ul><li><b>Scale & growth:</b> ARR £9.4m across 96 customers; average ARR/customer £98k. ARR growth 70% vs 19% benchmark — strong market fit.</li><li><b>Quality of revenue:</b> Recurring mix 94% (above 90% benchmark). Gross margin 78% and recurring margin 83% are solid.</li><li><b>Efficiency:</b> Rule of 40 at 63% and ARR per head 147 (vs 77 benchmark) show productive scaling. CAC ratio 0.56 with LTV:CAC 6.5 is attractive.</li><li><b>Pressure point:</b> Logo retention 85%, gross retention 79%, net retention 90% — all below benchmarks (91%/101%). This is the key limiter to compounding.</li><li><b>Spend mix:</b> S&M 37% of revenue (above 32% benchmark) while Development 28% (below 33%). Rebalancing toward post-sale success and product depth should help NRR.</li><li><b>Profitability:</b> EBIT -7% (slightly below -6% benchmark); improving trajectory expected as growth continues and retention improves.</li></ul><p><b>Actions</b></p><ul><li>Set a 2-quarter plan to raise NRR to ≥95% (milestone) and ≥100% by Q4 2026.</li><li>Shift 2–3 pts of spend from S&M to CS/Product without harming CAC; protect gross margin ≥78%.</li></ul>",
  "page2": "<p>Logos, ARR and Deals</p><ul><li><b>Logo dynamics:</b> December 2025 shows 8 new logos and 4 lost over the quarter; cumulative logos at 96, on track to scale to 168 by end-2027. Near-term logo retention is 96% in the period view, but the rolling metric on the Dashboard is lower (85%) — indicating recent improvement that must be sustained.</li><li><b>ARR engine:</b> For the quarter ending December 2025: Land £720k, Expand £236k, Downsell -£45k, Attrition -£405k → <b>ARR Net +£506k</b>. This pattern matches the 12‑month waterfall: strong additions (£4.41m) offset by elevated losses (-£0.88m) and modest downsell (-£0.27m).</li><li><b>Conversion to pipeline:</b> Deals volume (1,107 in Dec 2025) remains healthy; ensure post-sale coverage scales in step with logo growth to prevent lagging NRR.</li><li><b>Outlook:</b> Forecast builds ARR to £11.1m by Dec 2026 and £17.6m by Dec 2027 with improving retention metrics. Hitting the plan depends on keeping logo losses at or below forecast and increasing expansion rate from current levels.</li></ul><p><b>Actions</b></p><ul><li>Institutionalize a land-to-expand motion within 90 days of go-live to lift expansions per logo cohort.</li><li>Use churn learnings from the last 3 months (see ARR transactions) to update ICP disqualification and success plans.</li></ul>",
  "page3": "<p>P&L and Headcount</p><ul><li><b>Topline & margins:</b> Dec 2025 revenue £8.38m; gross margin £6.58m (78%). Margin is stable across the plan, supporting operating leverage.</li><li><b>OpEx mix:</b> S&M £3.10m (37%), Development £2.36m (28%), G&A £1.71m (20%). S&M is high vs benchmark and Dev is low, consistent with NRR headwinds.</li><li><b>Profit trajectory:</b> EBIT -£0.60m (-7%) at Dec 2025; crosses to positive by Jun 2026 and reaches ~6% by Dec 2027 as revenue scales to £15.8m with OpEx growth moderating.</li><li><b>Unit economics:</b> CAC ratio ~0.56–0.65 across periods; LTV:CAC dips to 6.5 now, recovering to ~9.7 by 2027 assuming retention lifts. This recovery is sensitive to NRR improvements.</li><li><b>Headcount:</b> 64 at Dec 2025, rising to 106 by Dec 2027. Largest additions are in Development and S&M. Maintain ARR per head ≥140 while hiring.</li></ul><p><b>Actions</b></p><ul><li>Reallocate 1–2 FTEs/quarter to Customer Success and in-product adoption to reduce time-to-value and churn.</li><li>Introduce margin gates on S&M programs (CAC payback ≤12 months equivalent given our ratios) to preserve Rule of 40 ≥60%.</li></ul>",

NRR rolled down from 114% to ~90% over the year, signaling rising churn/downsells in several geographies.</li><li><b>Retention by segment:</b> Energy & Utilities and Life Sciences show stronger net percentages vs Finance & Professional Services, which exhibits weaker retention (also reflected in last‑3‑month losses).</li><li><b>Concentration:</b> Top accounts drive meaningful monthly swings (ARR per customer grid). Several churn/reductions in Oct–Dec appear in a small set of customers, elevating concentration risk.</li></ul><p><b>Actions</b></p><ul><li>Double‑down sales capacity and references in Energy & Utilities; replicate its onboarding and expansion playbook to Government and North America.</li><li>For Finance & Professional Services: targeted roadmap commitments and executive QBRs for top 10 accounts; tie feature delivery to renewal milestones.</li><li>Install segment‑level NRR targets and owner accountability (vertical leads) with monthly variance reviews.</li></ul>",
