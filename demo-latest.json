  "executiveSummary": "<p>Actuals run through Dec 2025; all periods from Jan 2026 onward are forecast. We exit the year at ARR £9.4m, 12‑month growth ~70%, gross margin 78%, and EBIT at -7% for Dec quarter but trending toward breakeven in early 2026 and positive thereafter. Net ARR in the last three actual months was +£0.51m from 8 new logos, solid expansions, and concentrated churn in Finance & Professional Services. Energy & Utilities and Life Science remain the growth engines; North America and South America led regional adds in Q4. CAC efficiency is strong (0.56) and LTV:CAC 6.5; retention metrics are below benchmark and are the main constraint on operating leverage.</p>",
  "page1": "<p>Scale and growth: ARR £9.4m on 96 customers; average ARR £98k; ARR per head 147k with 64 heads. ARR growth 70% vs 19% benchmark, with a steady trend line.</p><p>Unit economics: Gross margin 78% and recurring margin 83% are healthy; recurring revenue mix 94%. CAC ratio 0.56 and LTV:CAC 6.5 indicate efficient go‑to‑market.</p><p>Retention: Logo 85%, gross 79%, net 90% all below benchmarks (91–101%). This aligns with the churn we see on pages 2, 4, and the Oct–Dec detail on page 5; improving retention is the largest value lever.</p><p>Spend mix and profit: S&M 37% of revenue (elevated vs 32% benchmark), R&D 28% (below 33% benchmark), G&A 20%. EBIT -7% with a flattening trend; Rule of 40 at 63% supported by growth more than margin.</p>",
  "page2": "<p>Logos and ARR: Closing Dec 2025 at 96 logos and ARR £9.4m. Q4 added 8 new logos and lost 4, for net +4; ARR Net in Q4 was +£506k (ties to page 5).</p><p>Retention and growth: Dec‑25 quarter shows logo retention 96%, gross retention 95%, NRR 98%; on a 12‑month basis, gross/net retention are 90%/90% (page 4), highlighting mid‑year churn headwinds. Growth slowed to 6% in Q4 from stronger earlier quarters as churn/downgrades offset lands.</p><p>Forward view: Forecast builds logos to 168 by Dec 2027 and ARR to £17.6m, with steady quarterly lands and improving retention into 2026–27.</p>",
  "page3": "<p>P&L through Dec 2025: Revenue £8.4m for the quarter, gross margin 78%. OpEx mix: S&M 37%, R&D 28%, G&A 20%. EBIT -£0.6m (-7%). CAC ratio 0.56; LTV:CAC 6.5. Rule of 40 63% driven by growth.</p><p>Forecast trajectory: Breakeven around mid‑2026 (EBIT turns positive from Jun‑26) and expands to ~6% EBIT margin by Dec‑27. Gross margin held at ~78% while OpEx ratios trend down as revenue scales.</p><p>Headcount: 64 at Dec‑25, ramping to 106 by Dec‑27, with most investment in R&D and S&M to support roadmap and pipeline conversion.</p>",
  "page4": "<p>ARR bridge (last 12 months to Dec‑25): Start £5.54m; expand £0.62m; downsell -£0.27m; lost -£0.88m; land £4.41m; ending ARR £9.42m. 12‑month gross/net retention both ~90%, pointing to concentrated churn.</p><p>Vertical mix: Energy & Utilities £3.95m and Life Science £2.50m lead and show the highest net growth; Finance & Professional Services £0.90m is smaller and more volatile (see page 5 churn).</p><p>Geography: South America £2.18m and Asia £2.09m are now our largest regions; North America £1.87m and Africa £1.86m close behind; Europe £1.42m.</p><p>Customer concentration: Growth is broad but a handful of customers drive the larger monthly deltas; focus renewals and CS coverage on the top green‑highlighted contributors and the red risk months.</p>",
  "page5": "<p>Last three actual months (Oct–Dec 2025): Net ARR +£506k on 8 new logos and 4 lost. Mix: New £720k, Expand £236k, Downsell -£45k, Lost -£405k.</p><p>By vertical: Energy & Utilities +£461k and Life Science +£180k offset Finance & Professional Services -£360k (primary churn/downsells). Government +£135k; 3rd Sector +£90k.</p><p>By region: North America +£315k and South America +£135k led; Asia +£90k; Africa -£34k net.</p><p>Customer notes: A small number of Finance & Professional Services customers account for most churn; Energy & Utilities contributed multiple £90–£101k lands/expands. This concentration explains the Q4 net retention softness on pages 1–2 and the vertical split on page 4.</p><p>Actions: Tighten renewal playbooks for Finance & Professional Services; prioritize multi‑year terms for E&U and Life Science; route CS capacity to at‑risk North American accounts while sustaining SA/NA new‑logo momentum.</p>"
